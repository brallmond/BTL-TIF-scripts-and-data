# BTL-TIF-scripts-and-data

This is a repo to keep scripts (and important related data) for BTL-TIF-operations together and somewhat organized.

Scripts, or any file ending with .py, .sh, .C, or .not-csv, should be placed in the scripts directory.
Please add your name and script-execution instructions at the top.

Data, basically any file ending in .csv that you'd like to be kept with your scripts, should be placed in the data directory.
Please title your data file similarly to the existing data files.
For example, a file containing temperature data for sensor 98-8-5 from data collect on April 12th of 2024 should be titled
`temperature_98_8_5_041220214.csv`

If your file contains data from multiple sensors, write a descriptive name, and add a comment at the top of the csv file with the exact sensors used and your best description of their corresponding physical component (i.e. LYSO, heater, Cu housing, etc.)
